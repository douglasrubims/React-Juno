# React Juno

#### A simple library for using Juno's auxiliary scripts in a React project. Its use may be slightly different from the original, but it is not at all difficult.
#### How to use: Include the files in your project, import them and use them according to your needs.
#### The functions that worked with callbacks in the original library now return the result.
